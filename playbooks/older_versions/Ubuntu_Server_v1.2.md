### Release Notes

- Added section: "Installing the Ubuntu Operating System"

### The following Ansible Playbooks are available

- [Install Cloud Native Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egx-platform/blob/master/playbooks/cnc-installation.yaml)

- [Validate Cloud Native Core ](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egx-platform/blob/master/playbooks/cnc-validation.yaml)

- [Uninstall Cloud Native Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egx-platform/blob/master/playbooks/cnc-uninstall.yaml)


## Prerequisites

- You have a NGC-Ready for Edge Server.
- You have Ubuntu Server 18.04.3 LTS installed.
- You will perform a clean install.
- The server has internet connectivity.

To determine if your system is NGC-Ready for Edge Servers, please review the list of validated systems on the NGC-Ready Systems documentation page: https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-ready-systems/index.html

Please note that the Cloud Native Core is only validated on Intel based NGC-Ready systems with the default kernel (not HWE). Using an AMD EPYC 2nd generation (ROME) NGC-Ready server is not validated yet and will require the HWE kernel and manually disabling nouveau.

### Installing the Ubuntu Operating System
These instructions require having Ubuntu Server LTS 18.04.3 on your NGC-Ready system. The Ubuntu Server can be downloaded from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/bionic/release/.

Disabling nouveau (not validated and only required with Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS HWE Kernel): 

```
$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
```

Insert the following:

```
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```

Regenerate the kernel initramfs:

```
$ sudo update-initramfs -u
```

And reboot your system:

```
$ sudo reboot
```

For more information on installing Ubuntu server please reference the [Ubuntu Server Installation Guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-install-ubuntu-server#1-overview).
 
## Using the Ansible playbooks 
This section describes how to use the ansible playbooks.

### Clone the git repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/egx-platform.git
$ cd egx-platform/playbooks
```
Update the hosts file in playbooks directory with master and worker nodes(if you have) IP's with username and password like below

```
$ sudo nano hosts

[master]
10.110.16.178 ansible_ssh_user=nvidia ansible_ssh_pass=nvidipass ansible_sudo_pass=nvidiapass ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
[node]
10.110.16.179 ansible_ssh_user=nvidia ansible_ssh_pass=nvidiapass ansible_sudo_pass=nvidiapass ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

## Available Cloud Native Core Version

Update the Cloud Native Core version as per below, currently supported versions are

- [1.2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egx-platform/blob/master/playbooks/Ubuntu_Server_v1.2.md)

```
sudo nano cnc_version.yaml

cnc_version: 1.2

```

### Installation

Install the Cloud Native Core by running the below command. "Skipping" in the ansible output refers to the Kubernetes cluster is up and running.

```
$ sudo bash setup.sh install
```

### Validation

Run the below command to check if the installed versions are match with predefined versions of the Cloud Native Core. Here' "Ignored" tasks refer to failed and "Changed/Ok" tasks refer to success.

Run the validation playbook after 5 minutes once completing the Cloud Native Core installation. Depends on your internet speed, you need to wait more time. 

```
$ sudo bash setup.sh validate
```

### Uninstall

Run the below command to uninstall the Cloud Native Core. Taks being "ignored" refers to no kubernetes cluster being available.

```
$ sudo bash setup.sh uninstall
```
